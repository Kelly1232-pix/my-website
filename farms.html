  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    The Kellys' Loyal Farms is a vision rooted in faith, unity, and transformation. As part of <strong>The Kellys' Loyal Family</strong>, we believe that agriculture is a God-given path to empower families, feed communities, and spark sustainable development.
    </p>
  <p>
    Our family is not royal, but loyal ‚Äî loyal to God and to our calling of impacting generations through practical action. Farming is not just a means of survival; it's a mission field where growth, stewardship, and hope are planted daily.

  <section data-aos="fade-up">
  <p><strong>Lets see what God says on this...</strong></p>
  <blockquote style="font-style: italic; background: papayawhip; padding: 20px; border-left: 7px dotted #2e7d32;">
    ‚ÄúAnd God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it:
    and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.‚Äù
    <br><strong>‚Äî Genesis 1:28 (KJV)</strong>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This verse reminds us of our God-given responsibility to steward the land, multiply its fruits, and care for His creation ‚Äî
    which is the heartbeat of The Kellys' Loyal Farms.

  <p>
    With God as our lead, we are raising a standard for agriculture in Uganda ‚Äî not just for ourselves, but for every household ready to sow, reap, and thrive.
  </p>

  <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>To promote sustainable agriculture and food security through community empowerment, education, and innovation ‚Äî transforming lives of Ugandans especially the needy into a global agricultural hub with God at the center.</p>
</section>

<section data-aos="fade-right">
  <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
  <p>To see every family in Uganda equipped with the knowledge, land, and tools to grow their own food, generate income, and support the wider community through farming excellence inspired by faith.</p>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>The Kellys' Loyal Family is setting up a visionary agricultural project aimed at transforming lives. We have already cultivated an acre of coffee trees in Rwamucucu, Rukiga District, and and we're planning to plant an additional 10,000 trees.</p>
  <p>We are expanding into large-scale banana plantations and fish ponds in Mbarara to support food supply for projects like <strong>The Kellys' Loyal Foundation</strong> which mainly invest its effort to bring hope and smiles to vulnerable people and Orphans. These efforts will also teach communities how agriculture can uplift lives and reduce poverty across Uganda.</p>
  <p><strong>God is in control.</strong> As our motto reminds us, "God is always our lead!"</p>
